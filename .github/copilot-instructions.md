Each blog post should have entries in English, Spanish, and Portuguese focused on the Docusaurus blog post engine.
Ensure each blog post includes metadata for title, description, and tags in all three languages.
  Example:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Example Title"
    description: "Description in English."
    tags: [example, blog]
    ---
    ```
Write the English version first, then translate into Spanish and Portuguese.
Use Markdown for content and ensure proper formatting for headings, lists, and code blocks.
   Example:
    ```markdown
    # Section Title

    ## Content goes here.

    - Point 1
    - Point 2
    ```
Use `npm start` to preview your blog locally before publishing.
Provide a clear and descriptive commit messages, e.g., `Add new blog post for GitHub Copilot best practices`.
