## Hello

My name is David Sanchez, I am a Computer Systems Engineer, developer, blogger, content creator and speaker. I live in Orlando, Florida but I was born and raised in Costa Rica. I work from my home office as an DevOps Solution Architect at Xebia | Xpirit but ***this website, and its content and opinions are my own***. 

I like to share content about technology, open source projects, soft skills, innovation, cloud and web development.

## Background

I worked at Microsoft for almost 7 years. Before joining Microsoft, I was a [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5000234) and a Software Development consultant for different companies in Costa Rica. Most of my experience is about Software Development and Collaboration Platforms. I am [Microsoft Certified Professional and Trainer](https://credly.com/users/dsanchezcr/badges).
