## Hello Friend!

I am David Sanchez, a Computer Systems Engineer, Developer, Blogger, Speaker, and Passionate at heart about Technology & Innovation. 

Sharing knowledge is my motivation, in this website you can learn more about open-source projects, soft skills, innovation, cloud, and software development. 

I live in Orlando, Florida but I am originally from Costa Rica (born and raised), I moved to United States of America back in 2018, I lived in Seattle before moving to Florida.

I speak Spanish (native), English (advanced) and Portuguese (limited) - This website is available in these three languages. My contributions are focused on the Microsoft & GitHub technology stack. 🧑🏼‍💻

However, since this is a personal website, I am also adding some of my hobbies in here, like movies 🎬, video games 🎮 or theme parks (Universal 🪄 & Disney 🏰) - including some tips & tricks.

I have over 15 years of experience in the technology industry focused on software development and collaboration platforms. I am [Microsoft Certified Professional and Trainer](https://learn.microsoft.com/users/dsanchezcr/transcript/7o62li8gpo3z6qr).

Before joining Microsoft, I was part of the [Microsoft Most Valuable Professional](https://mvp.microsoft.com) program. I love public speaking engagements (conferences & technical community events), volunteering and helping people to grow in their personal and professional careers. 🚀
