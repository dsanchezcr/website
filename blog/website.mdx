# A new website

Today I am relaunching my website based on Docusarious from Facebook. I am running it on Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Pages (because... why not?)

Something that caught my attention about this static generator is the localization functionality, as you can see, this websites supports English, Spanish and Portuguese.

Another thing, that liked me is that it supports React, TypeScript and Markdown (including MDX).
