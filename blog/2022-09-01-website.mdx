# A new website

Today I am relaunching my website based on [Docusarious from Facebook](https://docusaurus.io). I am running it on Azure Static Web Apps and GitHub Pages.

<!--truncate-->

A highlight from this static site generator is the localization functionality, as you can see, this websites supports English, Spanish and Portuguese.

Another thing, that liked me is the support of React, TypeScript and Markdown (including MDX).

In this blog I will be sharing tips about technology and, professional career development.

If you have any feedback or suggetion for content don't heasitate to reach out.

Thank you for reading!
