# Tips and Tricks for Adopting GitHub Copilot at Scale

## Introduction
Adopting GitHub Copilot at scale can be a game-changer for many development teams (especially large or distributed teams). This blog post provides best practices, actionable tips, and tricks to ensure a successful adoption of GitHub Copilot to ensure successful adoption at scale, foster engagement, and maximize the return on investment (ROI).

### 1. Raise Awareness and Streamline License Requests
One common challenge in organizations is ensuring that developers are aware of the tools and resources available to them. Simply buying the GitHub Copilot licenses is not enough, organizations must actively communicate their availability and make it easy for developers to access them. Here's how:

- Internal communication campaigns: Use newsletters, intranet, team meetings to inform teams about GitHub Copilot's availability and benefits.
- Streamlined license request process: Provide a simple mechanism—such as a dedicated portal or automated workflow—for developers to request or activate licenses. Here is a [sample license request template using IssueOps](https://github.com/microsoft/GitHubCopilotLicenseAssignment).
- Dedicated support: Assign a team or individual to assist with license activation, troubleshooting, and answering questions.

By reducing friction and ensuring visibility, leadership can accelerate adoption and ensure developers feel empowered to leverage GitHub Copilot fully.

### 2. Start with Clear Goals and Metrics
Define what success looks like for GitHub Copilot adoption within your organization. Leadership should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure impact.

Collect baseline data to compare pre- and post-adoption performance. Share these metrics broadly to create transparency and ensure teams can see the tangible benefits of using GitHub Copilot. Use resources like [GitHub Copilot Metrics](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-10-30-github-copilot-metrics-api-ga-release-now-available/) to track usage and impact.

### 3. Create Champions to Drive Adoption
Champions are vital to scaling new technologies. Identify enthusiastic developers who can become advocates for GitHub Copilot. Empower these champions with:

- Advanced training: Provide deeper insights into Copilot's features.
- Community leadership roles: Allow them to lead internal workshops and Q&A sessions.
- Recognition: Highlight their efforts through internal communications to inspire peers.

Champions can help bridge the gap between leadership's vision and developers' day-to-day work, creating a grassroots movement for adoption. Champions can provide training, support, and guidance to their peers, helping to drive adoption and address any concerns or challenges that may arise.

### 4. Establish Knowledge Bases and Prompt Libraries
A central knowledge repository ensures developers can access best practices, learn from others, and quickly get started. Consider including:

- Prompt templates: Share common prompts that developers can use as starting points - these prompts can be by role or by project type.
- Success stories: Showcase real examples of how teams are leveraging GitHub Copilot to solve problems.
- Troubleshooting FAQs: Provide guidance on addressing common challenges or misunderstandings (networking issues, code formatting, etc.).

A living KB for GitHub Copilot ensures continuous learning and adaptation, especially as it evolves.

### 5. Foster a Collaborative Culture
Promote a collaborative culture where team members share their experiences and learnings with GitHub Copilot. Encourage open communication and feedback to continuously improve the adoption process. Consider hosting regular meetings or workshops to discuss Copilot usage and share insights.

### 6. Provide Structured Training at Scale
Offer tailored training programs to accelerate learning curves:

- Interactive workshops: Host live coding sessions where teams can see GitHub Copilot in action.
- Role-based training: Design sessions for specific roles within the organization like frontend, backend, scripting, etc.
- Share existing resources: Leverage GitHub Copilot's [official learning paths](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/copilot) to help developers get started up to [get certified](https://examregistration.github.com).

The more familiar your teams are with GitHub Copilot, the more likely they are going to embrace it.

### 7. Communicate ROI to Stakeholders
Quantifying Copilot’s impact helps secure ongoing buy-in from leadership and developers alike. Focus on both tangible and intangible benefits, such as:

- Efficiency gains: Highlight time saved on repetitive coding tasks (documentation, testing, etc.).
- Quality improvements: Showcase how GitHub Copilot reduces errors by suggesting standardized and accurate code suggestions (quality, security best practices, etc.).
- Developer satisfaction: Emphasize how GitHub Copilot reduces burnout by enabling developers to focus on higher-value work faster and more effectively.

Use these insights to refine adoption strategies and showcase the value of investing in AI pair programming tools. Leverage [existing dashboards and reports](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/power-bi/github.github-copilot-metrics) to track progress and share insights with stakeholders. Use these metrics to identify areas for improvement and to celebrate successes.
