# List repositories with their sizes in Azure Repos

In this short post, I will show you how to list the Azure Repos in an Azure DevOps Project with their sizes in MB using a PowerShell script.
<!--truncate-->
To follow this post, you will need to create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with the **Code (read)** permission. You can read more about PAT in the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate).

```powershell
$DevOpsServerName = "<YOUR AZURE DEVOPS SERVER NAME>"
$ProjectCollection = "<YOUR PROJECT COLLECTION NAME>"
$Project = "<YOUR PROJECT NAME>"
$PAT = "<YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN>"

$baseUrl = https://$DevOpsServerName/$ProjectCollection/$Project/_apis/git/repositories?includeLinks={includeLinks}&includeAllUrls={includeAllUrls}&includeHidden={includeHidden}&api-version=6.0
$base64AuthInfo= [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(":$($PAT)"))
$headers = @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $base64AuthInfo)}
$repositories = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $baseUrl -Method Get -Headers $headers

foreach ($repo in $repositories.value) {
    $repoName = $repo.name
    $repoSize = [math]::Round(($repo.size / 1MB),2) 
    
    Write-Output "$repoName $repoSize MB"
} 
```

Here is an example of the output of that script:
```powershell
Tailwind Traders 10.65 MB
TailwindTraders-Backend 28.45 MB
TailwindTraders-Website 14.04 MB 
```

The script above use the Azure DevOps Rest API to get the repositories and their sizes. You can read more about the API in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/azure/devops/git/repositories/list).

This is helpful to know the size of your repositories in case you are planning to do a migration, or in case you would like to know if you have large files, and to know if you need to clean up some of them.

Hope this helps!
