# Cloud Development Environments

In this post I am going to talk about the different options that we have to create a cloud development environment offered by Microsoft & GitHub.

<!--truncate-->

Let's start with the definition of it:

## What is a cloud development environment?

It is a complete development environment that is hosted in the cloud, includes everything you need to write, run, and debug your code. It is accessible from anywhere and from any device.

## Why use a cloud development environment?

There are many reasons to use a cloud development environment. Some of the main benefits include:

- Convenience: accessible from anywhere and from any device. This means you can work on your code from anywhere, whether you are at home, in the office, or on the go.
- Scalability: add or remove resources as needed. This means you can quickly scale up to meet increased demand, or scale down to save costs when demand is low.
- Flexibility: customize it to meet your specific needs. This means you can choose the tools and resources that work best for you, and you can easily change them as needed.
- Collaboration: share your code with others, review pull requests, and work together on the same codebase.

## Different options for cloud development environments

There are many different options for creating a cloud development environment. Some of the most popular options include:

### 1. GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that you can use to develop your GitHub repositories. You can use it to write, run, and debug your code with a complete development environment in your browser. You can also use it to review pull requests and collaborate with others.

#### DevContainers

DevContainers is a cloud-based development environment that you can use to develop your repositories. You can use it to write, run, and debug your code with a complete development environment in your browser. You can also use it to review pull requests and collaborate with others.

### 2. Microsoft DevBox

Microsoft DevBox is a cloud-based development environment that you can use to develop your Microsoft repositories. You can use it to write, run, and debug your code with a complete development environment in your browser. You can also use it to review pull requests and collaborate with others.

#### Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop is a cloud-based development environment that you can use to develop your Azure repositories. You can use it to write, run, and debug your code with a complete development environment in your browser. You can also use it to review pull requests and collaborate with others.
