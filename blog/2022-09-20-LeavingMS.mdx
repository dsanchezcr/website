# I'm leaving Microsoft

After almost 7 years, today is my last day at Microsoft. It has been great, I cannot say thank you enough to all the teammates, managers, and mentors I've had over the years that have helped me grow and enjoy the journey.

I will be eternally grateful to Microsoft for all the opportunities, experiences, learnings, all the support I received and especially for all the awesome people I met and had the opportunity to work with.

While I am leaving Microsoft, my mission will continue. Tomorrow, I'll start a new adventure as an Azure & DevOps Consultant to continue helping people to build the most innovative solutions with technology.
