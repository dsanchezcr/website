# Passed the GitHub Partner Certifications

I'm thrilled to share that I just earned the three GitHub Partner Certifications.

The GitHub Partner Certifications are a set of three exams that cover the GitHub platform and its ecosystem. The exams are designed to test your knowledge of the GitHub. 

The three exams are:
- [GitHub Actions](https://credly.com/badges/e8a1a5a0-f95c-4bfd-b6cb-81ea1231153f)
- [GitHub Admin](https://credly.com/badges/79b12418-8217-4c7b-a1a0-ad6f6cf407df)
- [GitHub Advanced Security](https://credly.com/badges/b32ce8d3-d9e1-423c-8d1a-958901f3d798)

The [Microsoft Learn collections](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/github) helped me a lot to prepare for the exams. I recommend you to check them out.

I'm looking forward to continue learning and sharing my knowledge with the community.
