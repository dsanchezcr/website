Xbox and PC are my primary gaming platforms. Below you can see my live Xbox profile data pulled directly from Xbox Live.

## My Xbox Profile

<XboxProfileWidget />

:::info Xbox Game Pass Ultimate
One of the perks of being a Microsoft employee is getting **Xbox Game Pass Ultimate** every year. This is hands down the best value in gaming:

- **Day-one access** to first-party titles, play highly anticipated games like the upcoming **Forza 6** the moment they launch
- **Cloud Gaming** stream hundreds of games to virtually any device, including phones, tablets, browsers, and even my **Meta Quest 3S** via Xbox Cloud Gaming
- **Hundreds of games** in the catalog across genres, with new titles added regularly
- **EA Play** included access to EA's library of sports, racing, and action games
- **Member deals & discounts** on game purchases and DLC
- **Xbox Live Gold** included for online multiplayer

:::tip Xbox Play Anywhere & My Devices
With **Xbox Play Anywhere**, many games I buy digitally work across all my devices:

- **Xbox Console** (Xbox One / Series X|S) my main living room setup is on Series X and in my office I have an Xbox One X
- **Desktop PC** for higher fidelity and mouse & keyboard gaming (Age of Empires Series, Flight Simulator, etc)
- **ASUS ROG Ally** an amazing handheld PC that has become my go-to for portable gaming

Progress, achievements, and saves sync seamlessly across all devices. Start a game on the couch, continue on the ROG Ally during a flight, and finish on PC all from the same save.
